$ expense-tracker add --description "Lunch" --amount 20
# Expense added successfully (ID: 1)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Go**: Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Steps to Install and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-tracker-cli.git
   cd expense-tracker-cli
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build -o expense-tracker ./cmd
   ```

3. Run the Expense Tracker CLI:

## File Storage

The expense data is stored locally in a JSON file (`data/expenses.json`). You can customize the file path by modifying the relevant section in the code.

## Future Enhancements

- Allow filtering expenses by categories (e.g., food, travel, etc.).
- Add a feature to export expenses to a CSV file.
- Improve user interface for better usability.
- Implement database storage (e.g., SQLite) for larger datasets.
